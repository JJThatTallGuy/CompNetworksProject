This is a standard android project thatruns on jellybean or newer (99% android devices). 
If you want to run, you'll need to run on a supported android device or install an emulator which may require changing bios settings.
I believe you need android studio to compile but you can view any of the java files in any text editor.
If you have issues with the code I have it on a repo I can give you access to at https://github.com/JJThatTallGuy/CompNetworksProject/
Demo is here https://youtu.be/in-4L4TvivM
